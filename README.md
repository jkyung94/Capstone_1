# Jobs for H-1B Visa

## Problem
The H-1B Visa is a highly desired non-immigrant visa and the most common visa status applied for and held by international students upon graduating college/higher education and work in a full-time position. Not every company is willing to support the visa so immigrants tend to have a more difficult time finding a job. This project will attempt to predict which jobs and occupations will more successfully get a visa.
