# Repurpose-Drugs

## Problem
![alt text](https://pulse.embs.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/05/keshava02-2678638.jpg)

The drug discovery process is expensive, risky, complicated, and long. In fact, the costs of developing new drugs are only rising, but the amount of new drugs introduced fluctuates by the year. New techniques like drug repurposing help lower costs and time to bring new compounds to clinical trials and markets, but as we continue to invest billions of dollars into new therapeutics, one question we should address first is how efficiently we are addressing different diseases and injuries out there. Are we channeling the right amount of resources to different diseases or need to reprioritize and reproportion them to best fit the needs present and for the needs to come? Can we predict what diseases will become more prominent or find diseases that have become too neglected? Then can we consider already existing compounds for different diseases not considered originally? This project seeks to answer these questions.
