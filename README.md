# Jobs for H-1B Visa and US Permanent Visas

## Problem
The H-1B Visa is a highly desired non-immigrant visa and the most common visa status applied for and held by international students upon graduating college/higher education and work in a full-time position. Other than these visas, the U.S. Permanent Visa is also highly desirable. Not every company is willing to support the visa so immigrants tend to have a more difficult time finding a job. This project will attempt to predict where they can more successfully get a job who sponsors them in the country.
