    "## H-1B Visa \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "The H-1B Visa is a highly desired non-immigrant visa and the most common visa status applied for and held by international students upon graduating college/higher education and work in a full-time position. Not every company is willing to support the visa so immigrants tend to have a more difficult time finding a job. This project will attempt to predict which occupations will more successfully get a visa.\n",

    "### [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/jkyung94/Capstone_1/blob/master/H1B_Wrangling.ipynb)\n",
    "The dataset was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nsharan/h-1b-visa/data) which had H-1B visa Petitions for the period 2011 to 2016. Upon finding 5% NaN values within the dataset, those values were dropped since it would have minor effects on the dataset. Years were changed to string values to drop the \".0\" at the end and also outliers in the wages were removed from the dataset. String values in the occupation field were changed to all have the same upper case and the worksite that had both city and state within one field was split so that there would be one new field for just the states. This relatively cleaned dataset was then saved to another file called \"h1b_kaggle_clean.csv\". \n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Potential Datasets to Supplement\n",
    "Kaggle recently retrieved another H-1B visa petition dataset for 2017 which could be added for further investigation. Otherwise, if there were similar datasets with more fields than the ones given from this dataset, they could be merged to gain new and more features. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Findings: [EDA](https://github.com/jkyung94/Capstone_1/blob/master/h1b_EDA.ipynb) and [Inferential Statistics](https://github.com/jkyung94/Capstone_1/blob/master/h1b_stats.ipynb)\n",
    "Upon initial review, there were significantly more certified H-1B visas than denied (~2,500,000 vs. ~100,000) that showed that a good number of people who apply for H-1B visas usually get certified rather than denied (relieving some anxiety). The top employers were mainly in the information technology, consulting, internet industries with the top employer being Infosys Limited, aligning with the fields of the top occupations and job titles (computers, software, analysts). Petitions doubled within the 5 years between 2011-2016 and seems like the demand will only grow, implying how many more international people are seeking to move to USA. There did not seem to be a big difference in salaries between the certified and denied visas. Finally, looking at the different states, California has the most certified and denied petitions, along with the most amount of jobs in the Computer Systems Analysts occupation, which was the top occupation that had the most amount of certified petitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi square test was performed to see the relationship between the categorical values. The null hypothesis was that the certain feature we were looking to test had no relationship whatsoever (independent) to H-1B petitions. Upon going through every feature (employer, occupation, job title, full time position, wage, year, state), the null hypothesis was rejected overall, which showed how every feature has some relationship with the case status of the H-1B visa petitions. As to which ones are more significant than the other, we will need to explore in more detail."
